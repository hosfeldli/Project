Project Description: Stackscope was built to streamline management of cloud service credentials. Users can 'add' (upload) JSON files (which are stored in MongoDB) that are associated with their unique ID (which are stored in cookies). Stackscope organizes virtual machines(VM) and their respective disks allowing users to access information about any of their VM's with ease. Users can also 'edit' by adding labels to existing credentials. The users can also 'delete' credentials from Stackscope.
